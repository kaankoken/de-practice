# Data Engineering Practice

A simple project to practice data engineering skills & migrating python projects to rust.

The project is purely created for learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) by projects.

## Who am I?

My name is Kaan. I am a software developer at [GAÄ°N](www.gain.tv), writing flutter. I like to experiment and learn new things. Apart from that, I am passionate about Data-engineering & open-source. I am also a big fan of Rust. I am trying to learn Rust through projects. **I am open to any kind of feedback.**

## Used Libraries

- [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) for parsing command line arguments.

## TODO

You could reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaan_lego_koken) to discuss the project & help me to improve myself & the project.

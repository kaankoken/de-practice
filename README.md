# Data Engineering Practice

A simple project to practice data engineering skills & migrating python projects to rust.

The project is purely created for learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) by projects.

## Who am I?

My name is Kaan. I am a software developer at [GAÄ°N](www.gain.tv), writing flutter. I like to experiment and learn new things. Apart from that, I am passionate about Data-engineering & open-source. I am also a big fan of Rust. I am trying to learn Rust through projects. **I am open to any kind of feedback.**

## Used Libraries

### Rust

- [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) for parsing command line arguments.
- [zld](https://github.com/michaeleisel/zld) for faster linking to the binary ([download-link](brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld)).
- [bacon](https://github.com/Canop/bacon) background rust code checker.
- [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) for generating changelog from conventional git commits.

### Python

- [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) Tool for data manipulation and analysis.

### TODO

- [ ] Add unit tests for both scripts.
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipelines for both scripts.
- [ ] Create badges for the project.
- [ ] Experiment with dockerizing the project.
- [ ] Experiment with docker-compose & terraform.
